## PIPXU - Install and Run Python Applications in Isolated Environments using UV
[![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pipxu)](https://pypi.org/project/pipxu/)
[![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/pipxu)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pipxu/)

[`pipxu`][pipxu] installs Python applications, i.e. Python packages
which have one or more executable programs, into independent isolated
virtual environments on your system. Each package and it's dependencies
are thus insulated from all other applications, and from the system
Python. [`pipxu`][pipxu] creates links to application executables in a
common directory, which you have in your [PATH][path]. Packages are
typically sourced from [PyPI][pypi], the Python Package Index.

[`pipxu`][pipxu] is a re-implementation of most of the functionality of
the popular [`pipx`][pipx] tool but is **much faster** because it uses
[`uv`][uv] to create and install application virtual environments
instead of [`venv`][venv] and [`pip`][pip] as used by [`pipx`][pipx].
The [`pipxu`][pipxu] code has been developed completely independently of
[`pipx`][pipx] and is not a fork. For compatibility and ease of
migration, the provided commands have the same names as [`pipx`][pipx].
Most commands are implemented, at least for common use cases, although
some command functionality, options, and output are slightly different.

This utility has been developed and tested on Linux. It has been briefly
tested and seems to run ok on Windows. It will likely work on macOS, but
has not been tried there. The latest documentation and code is available
at https://github.com/bulletmark/pipxu.

## Installation and Upgrade

Python 3.8 or later is required. Arch Linux users can install [`pipxu`
from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pipxu) and skip this
section.

The [`uv`][uv] program is also required (version must be >=0.1.33).
The following is an easy way to install it, see
[here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#getting-started).

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Note [`pipxu` is on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pipxu/). Run the tiny
[bootstrap shell
script](https://github.com/bulletmark/pipxu/blob/main/pipxu-bootstrap)
which installs `pipxu` to a temporary directory then runs `pipxu` from
there to install itself normally:

```sh
$ curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bulletmark/pipxu/main/pipxu-bootstrap | sh
```

Or install `pipxu` using `pipx` if you prefer (or you are using Windows
where `pipxu-bootstrap` does not work):

```sh
$ pipx install pipxu
$ pipxu install pipxu
$ pipx uninstall pipxu
```

To upgrade:

```sh
$ pipxu upgrade pipxu
```

To uninstall all `pipxu` installed applications, and then uninstall
`pipxu` itself:

```sh
$ pipxu uninstall --all --skip pipxu
$ pipxu uninstall pipxu
```

## Recovery

The `pipxu` package also installs the aforementioned
[`pipxu-bootstrap`](https://github.com/bulletmark/pipxu/blob/main/pipxu-bootstrap)
shell script on your system so you can always recover easily from a
broken `pipxu` installation by manually running that script. E.g. The
following may be needed after a major or incompatible Python version
upgrade where `pipxu` may have stopped working:

```sh
$ pipxu-bootstrap
$ pipxu reinstall --all --skip pipxu
```

## Comparison to pipx

Why would you use [`pipxu`][pipxu] instead of [`pipx`][pipx]? The main
reason is to gain a massive speed improvement. `pipx` uses [`python -m
venv`][venv] to create and install virtual environments and [`pip`][pip]
to install packages whereas `pipxu` uses [`uv`][uv] for these
operations. [`uv`][uv] is [a new project](https://astral.sh/blog/uv)
written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) which has a better design
than [`venv`][venv] + [`pip`][pip], caches aggressively, and is **much
faster**. Also, `pipx` installs `pip` into each virtual environment
using a shared overlay which it has to update periodically so you
sometimes experience `pipx` seeming to hang for a while while this
update occurs. `pipxu` just creates a minimal lean virtual environment
and uses `uv` for all operations so does not need to do this periodic
update.

Note that `pipx` offers some esoteric options and features which `pipxu`
does not have. `pipxu` caters for the common use cases. `pipxu` never
modifies your PATH.

`pipxu` adds some small but handy features not present in `pipx`:

1. For the commands `uninstall`, `reinstall`, and `upgrade`, `pipx` only
   allows you to specify one application whereas `pipxu` allows you to
   specify one or more applications. To do an operation on **all**
   applications, `pipx`, requires you use a corresponding `*-all`
   command, e.g. to `upgrade` all applications you use `upgrade-all`.
   `pipxu` simply offers a `--all` option on each of those base commands
   to do the same thing, thus avoiding the need for the extra `*-all`
   commands. Also, `pipx` also does not offer `--skip` for all those
   `*-all` commands consistently, whereas `pipxu` does.

2. You can do `pipxu` commands on an editable projects (as often used by
   developers) in the current directory by simply typing "`.`" as the
   package name and this works for all commands. E.g. `pipxu uninstall
   .` or `pipxu inject . pudb`. I.e. `pipxu` automatically determines
   the package name associated with the current directory. Note that
   `pipx` accepts "`.`" for the install command, but not for any others.

3. For Python developers,`pipxu` adds a [`debug`](#command-debug)
   command to conveniently run an installed application using a
   debugger. `pipx` does not have this command. Read more about the
   `debug` command [here](doc/debug.md).

4. If run as root or with `sudo`, `pipxu` installs applications to a
   global location.

## Environment Variables

Type `pipxu` without any arguments to see usage and the current
environment. The environment is printed at the bottom of the screen
output as follows:

E.g. run as my user "mark":

```
Environment:
PIPXU_HOME = /home/mark/.local/share/pipxu
PIPXU_BIN_DIR = /home/mark/.local/bin
PIPXU_MAN_DIR = /home/mark/.local/share/man
PIPXU_DEFAULT_PYTHON = python3

Your PATH contains PIPXU_BIN_DIR (/home/mark/.local/bin).
```

Or run as root, or with [`sudo`](https://www.sudo.ws/):

```
Environment:
PIPXU_HOME = /opt/pipxu
PIPXU_BIN_DIR = /usr/local/bin
PIPXU_MAN_DIR = /usr/local/share/man
PIPXU_DEFAULT_PYTHON = python3

WARNING: Your PATH does not contain PIPXU_BIN_DIR (/usr/local/bin).
```

You can set those environment variables, or provide them as command line
options, to override the defaults if you want. Note, as seen in the
output above, `pipxu` reports if `PIPXU_BIN_DIR` is included or not in
your PATH. To ensure you can run the applications installed by `pipxu`,
that directory **must be in your PATH**. E.g. for most users on Linux
using the default locations, ensure that `~/.local/bin` is [added to
your PATH environment variable][path].

## Command Default Options

You can add default global options to a personal configuration file
`~/.config/pipxu-flags.conf`. If that file exists then each line of
options will be concatenated and automatically prepended to your `pipxu`
command line arguments. Comments in the file (i.e. `#` and anything
after on a line) are ignored. Type `pipxu` to see all supported options.

The global options: `--uv`, `--no-man-pages`, `--home`, `--bin-dir`,
`--man-dir`, `--default-python`, are the only sensible candidates to
consider setting as defaults.

## Command Line Tab Completion

Command line shell [tab
completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion) is
automatically enabled on `pipxu` commands and options using
[`argcomplete`](https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete). You may need to
first (once-only) [activate argcomplete global
completion](https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete#global-completion).
